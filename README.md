# PentestAgent

## Overview

**PentestAgent** is a novel LLM-driven penetration testing framework to automate intelligence gathering, vulnerability analysis, and exploitation stages, reducing manual intervention.

The framework is modular and consists of the following components:

- **Reconnaissance Agent**: Gathers intelligence about the target system.
- **Planning Agent**: Identifies and prioritizes vulnerabilities and potential exploits.
- **Execution Agent**: Attempts to execute selected exploits in a controlled environment.

For further is information, please refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05185).

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

> **Note:** We recommend deploying this project on a **Kali Linux** environment for better compatibility with penetration testing tools and workflows.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/nbshenxm/pentest-agent.git
cd pentest-agent
```

------

### 2. Set Environment Variables

Several environment variables need to be filled in. If you are not familiar with environment variables, set them in the `.env` file.

**Required:**
- `PDCP_API_KEY`: ProjectDiscovery API key for accessing CVE data and vulnerability information.
- `GITLAB_TOKEN`: GitLab token for ExploitDB access. 
- `GITHUB_KEY`: GitHub token for searching repositories and issues.
- `INDEX_STORAGE_DIR`: Directory to store vector indexes for RAG.
- `PLANNING_OUTPUT_DIR`: Directory to save planning results.
- `LOG_DIR`: Directory to store logs.

**Optional:**
- `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`: If using a proxy or VPN.

------

### 3. Install Python Dependencies

Python version: **3.12**

Use a virtual environment:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or with Conda:

```
conda create -n pentest python=3.12
conda activate pentest
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

------

### 4. Install CVEMAP

[CVEMAP](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/cvemap) is needed to fetch CVE-related information. Follow their [installation](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/cvemap?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) instructions.

------

## ⚙️ Configuration

### File: `pentest_agent/configs/config.yaml`

#### **(1) models**
 
Specify the LLM provider, model name, temperature, and API key.

#### **(2) cve**

Set the model used for parsing CVE entries and its generation temperature.

#### **(3) cve_scoring**

Scoring criteria for evaluating CVEs:

- Vulnerability type
- Exploit maturity
- Remote exploitability
- Attack complexity
- Source weighting (ExploitDB, GitHub, Google)

#### **(4) runtime**

**Reconnaissance Agent:**

- `current_topic`: Topic identifier for current CVE task.
- `target_ip`: IP address of the target host.

**Planning Agent:**

- `model`: LLM Model used for searching exploits and analyzing vulnerability data.
- `keyword`, `app`, `version`: Target application details.
- `vuln_type`: Type of vulnerability to focus on.
- `cvemap_fuzzy_search`: Enable fuzzy search for CVE matching.
- `output_dir`: Directory to save analysis results.

**Execution Agent:**

- `current_topic`: Task/topic identifier.
- `doc_dir`: Directory containing exploit scripts or documents.
- `target_ip`, `target_port`: IP and port of target host.
- `attacker_ip`: IP of attacker's machine.
- `command_to_execute`: Payload to validate exploitation.
- `model`: LLM Model used for exploit execution guidance.

## 🚀 Running the Agents (Manual)

### Reconnaissance Agent

- **File**: `pentest_agent/agents/recon_agent.py`
- **Function**: Given a target IP, gathers system and service info.
- **Usage**: Set the topic, LLM model, and IP, then run the script.

```
python pentest_agent/agents/recon_agent.py
```

------

### Planning Agent

- **File**: `pentest_agent/agents/planning_agent.py`
- **Function**: Identifies relevant CVEs and associated exploits from multiple sources.
- **Sources**: 
  - GitHub repositories and issues
  - ExploitDB entries
  - Google search results
- **Features**: Multi-source intelligence aggregation with configurable LLM backends
- **Usage**: Set the model and application information.

```
python pentest_agent/agents/planning_agent.py
```

------

### Execution Agent

- **File**: `pentest_agent/agents/execution_agent.py`
- **Function**: Executes selected exploits based on previous analysis and collected context.
- **Usage**: Set the topic, exploit document path, and target info.

```
python pentest_agent/agents/execution_agent.py
```

------

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

PentestAgent provides Docker support for isolated execution of each agent.

### 0. Pre-Configuration

#### Step 1: Edit `pentest_agent/configs/config.yaml`

Configure all agent parameters under the `models`, `cve`, `cve_scoring`, and `runtime` sections.

#### Step 2: Config `.env` in `pentest_agent/docker`

Example `.env` content:

```
GITHUB_KEY=your_github_token
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN=your_hf_token
INDEX_STORAGE_DIR=/path/to/indexes
PLANNING_OUTPUT_DIR=/path/to/output
LOG_DIR=/path/to/logs
```

------

### 1. Start and Run Reconnaissance Agent

```
cd pentest_agent/docker
docker-compose up --build -d recon
```

------

### 2. Start and Run Planning Agent

```
cd pentest_agent/docker
docker-compose up --build -d planning
```

------

### 3. Start and Run Execution Agent

```
cd pentest_agent/docker
docker-compose up --build -d execution
```

------

## 📊 Benchmark & Evaluation

### Infrastructure

We adopt [Vulhub](https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub) for evaluating the system. Vulhub provides Docker-based vulnerable environments with real-world CVEs.

### Target Selection

We select vulnerabilities based on the following criteria:

- Must have a valid CVE ID
- Must include a CVSS v3.x score
- Additional labels include:
  - CWE ID
  - Exploitability sub-score
  - Difficulty levels derived from the CVSS vector

### Our results
It's been a while since we performed our evaluation. We are working on including some new scenarios in addition to the VulHub in the benchmark, as well as evaluating PentestAgent on a variety of advanced LLM backbones. We will publish our results on the benchmark these works are finished.
